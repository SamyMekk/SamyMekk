## About Me

I'm currently a 24-year-old PhD student at Ecole Polytechnique at the [CMAP](https://cmap.ip-paris.fr/) laboratory working on stochastic control and mean field systems . I specialize in Actuarial and Financial Science, which  involves a deep knowledge of statistics, stochastic calculus, and programming.

I graduated from [ENSAE Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/) and [M2MO](https://masterfinance.math.univ-paris-diderot.fr/) from the end of 2024.

On this GitHub, you may find various projects that I completed during my university studies.
Don't hesitate to take a look at my [website](https://samymekk.github.io) which I will  regularly update.


Outside of work, here are some of my passions:

- **Sports**: Playing football and table tennis.
- **Traveling**: Discovering new cultures and landscapes.
