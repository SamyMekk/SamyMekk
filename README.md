## About Me

I'm currently a 24-year-old PhD Student at Ecole Polytechnique working on stochastic control and mean field systems. I specialize in Actuarial and Financial Science, which also involves a deep knowledge of statistics, stochastic calculus, and programming.
On this GitHub, you may find various projects that I completed during my university studies.
Don't hesitate to take a look at my [website](https://samymekk.github.io) which I will  regularly update.


Outside of work, here are some of my passions:

- **Sports**: Playing football and table tennis.
- **Traveling**: Discovering new cultures and landscapes.
